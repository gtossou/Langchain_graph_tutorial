        "# Understanding LangChain Runnables and LCEL\n",
        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",
        "\n",
        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Types of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Language Models**: Like our `ChatOpenAI` instance\n",
        "- **Prompt Templates**: Format inputs consistently\n",
        "- **Retrievers**: Get relevant context from a vector store\n",
        "- **Output Parsers**: Structure model outputs\n",
        "- **LangGraph Nodes**: Individual components in our graph\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of Runnables as the building blocks of your LLM application. Just like how you can combine LEGO bricks in countless ways, you can mix and match Runnables to create increasingly sophisticated applications!\n",

        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Cycles?\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!\n",

        "\n",
        "Earlier we used this phrasing:\n",
        "\n",
        "> coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications\n",
        "\n",
        "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in our example here, we're focusing on a simpler `State` object:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class State(TypedDict):\n",
        "    question: str\n",
        "    context: List[Document]\n",
        "    response: str\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [Document(page_content=\"...some data...\")],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"The Eiffel Tower is about 324 meters tall...\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",

              "'LCEL, or LangChain Expression Language, works as a declarative way to compose chains together. It offers several benefits, including:\\n\\n1. **Async, Batch, and Streaming Support**: Chains constructed using LCEL automatically have full support for synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming interfaces. This makes it easy to prototype a chain in a Jupyter notebook with synchronous behavior and then transition to an asynchronous streaming interface.\\n\\n2. **Fallbacks**: Due to the non-determinism of LLMs (Large Language Models), LCEL allows for easy attachment of fallbacks to any chain, which helps in handling errors gracefully.\\n\\n3. **Parallelism**: LCEL syntax enables components that can be executed in parallel to do so automatically, which is important as LLM applications often involve long API calls.\\n\\nOverall, LCEL streamlines the process of building robust and efficient chains for LLM applications.'"
